# TechcareerBootcampProject

This project made in 4 days, i know that it has some issues about controller/authentication but overall it is working and made by me.
My first focus is creating finished and GOOD LOOKING project which is actually I've done.
If I could I'ld implement pop-up messages of actions, common design page, service layer etc.
It ain't much, but it's honest work.
